SearchEngineWebApp
==================
This is the source code of 542 final project. We built a hotel search engine which implements the skyline query. In build folder, there are two java classes, one is the back end server(/SearchEngine/src/classes/com/searchEngine/controller.java) and another one is the database connector(/SearchEngine/src/classes/query/database/first/DATABASEAccess.java). In the WebContent folder, there are several jsp files which are our web design. Here the "/SearchEngine/WebContent/RealHome.jsp" functions as the home page, and this is where the search engine web app boots from.
